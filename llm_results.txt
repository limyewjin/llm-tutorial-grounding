This quote directly answers the question.  It states that subscriber growth was approximately 49-fold.  While it doesn't give the exact numbers, it provides the relative growth which is what the question asks for.

This quote states that subscribers grew 49 times, but it does not give the exact starting and ending numbers of subscribers.  Therefore, it lacks sufficient detail to answer the question precisely.  To calculate the exact growth, we need the initial and final subscriber counts.  However, we do have the final subscriber count of over 701,000 as of December 31, 2022.

<answer>The provided text states a 49-fold increase in subscribers between December 2018 and December 2022, but does not provide the initial subscriber count to calculate the exact numerical growth. </answer>
